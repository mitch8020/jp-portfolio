## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

As a part of learning the different features of Node.js and Express.js, I built an API while using data from the https://marvel.fandom.com website. This API includes the utilization of retrieving files from the Heroku server using the Express.js provided 'get' method as well as a brief example at the bottom of the site using promises, async/await, and event listeners.

## Lessons Learned:

This project has been a great reminder that a big part of programming and engineering is troubleshooting problems and debugging code. I caught a few typos in my variables before I spent hours debugging them. I've made sure to test that all of the JSON objects work when requested and created a client-test folder with HTML & JS to test that the image links are working.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
